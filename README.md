# What is "Chan"?    
  Chinese technical analysis method called Chanlun, also known as "The Theory of Chan" in English. This method was developed by a Chinese stock market analyst named Chan Zhong Shuo Chan. The core idea of Chanlun is to study the patterns of stock price fluctuations and market psychology in order to identify potential trading opportunities.
  
  
# Features:
 
## Chanlun mainly focuses on the following aspects:

- Price Trends: Chanlun believes that stock market price trends follow certain patterns. By analyzing these trends, it is possible to predict the short-term rise and fall of stock prices.
- Fractal Structure: Chanlun emphasizes the importance of fractal structure, suggesting that stock price fluctuations exhibit self-similar fractal patterns. In other words, similar patterns of price movements can be observed regardless of the scale of the stock price chart.
- Key Support and Resistance Levels: Chanlun focuses on stock price movements within specific price ranges, particularly the key support (buying pressure) and resistance (selling pressure) levels. By studying these levels, investors can determine the timing of their trades.
- Market Psychology: Chanlun emphasizes the impact of market psychology on stock price fluctuations. Investor sentiment and psychological expectations can lead to short-term price fluctuations, creating buying and selling opportunities.
- Capital Management: Chanlun believes that successful investing is not just about predicting price trends, but also involves proper capital management. By allocating funds reasonably, investors can reduce risk and increase returns.
In summary, Chanlun is a unique technical analysis method designed to help investors capture market opportunities by studying the patterns of stock price fluctuations and market psychology. However, like other technical analysis methods, Chanlun cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. Investors should exercise caution when using Chanlun and consider incorporating other analytical tools and methods.
